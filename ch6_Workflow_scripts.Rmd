this chapter goes over how to use the script editor, which is what i've been working in to create this markdown doccos. 

###6.1 Running code

sample code
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(nycflights13)

not_cancelled <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_delay), !is.na(arr_delay))

not_cancelled %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay))
```

I'm guessing this is a chapter full of hotkeys and best-practices ?

command+shift+s runs the scripts (mac)
ctrl+shift+s runs the scrupts (pc)

    * start your scripts with necessary packages. if you're sharing code, it calls out which packages need to be loaded. 
    * "Note, however, that you should never include install.packages() or setwd() in a script that you share. It’s very antisocial to change settings on someone else’s computer!"
    
### 6.3 Practice

yeah ok, short chapter.
